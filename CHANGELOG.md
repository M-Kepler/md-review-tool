# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### ✨ New Features
- **Editable YAML Front Matter in Rich Mode** — The YAML Front Matter block in Rich Mode editor is now editable via double-click. A custom `FrontmatterNodeView` renders the frontmatter with a styled header (⚙️ YAML Front Matter) and preview content; double-clicking enters edit mode with a textarea. Editing is completed via Ctrl+Enter or clicking outside. Tab key inserts 2-space indentation for YAML formatting. The node updates via `setNodeMarkup` to properly trigger document dirty state. Supports both dark and light themes.
- **Link bubble menu in Rich Mode editor** — Clicking a hyperlink in Rich Mode now shows a floating bubble menu near the link with: URL preview (clickable to open in new tab), edit button (opens the toolbar link popover for full editing), open in new tab button, copy link button, and unlink button (removes the link mark while preserving text). The menu auto-closes on scroll, clicking outside, or exiting Rich Mode. Added `openExternalLink` message handler in extension host to support opening URLs via `vscode.env.openExternal`.
- **Table grid selector in Rich Mode toolbar** — The table toolbar button now opens a 6×6 grid popover instead of directly inserting a fixed 3×3 table. Users can hover over the grid to select the desired number of rows and columns (displayed as "R × C" label below the grid), then click to insert a table of that exact size. The `insertTable` ProseMirror command now accepts `attrs.rows` and `attrs.cols` parameters; when called without attrs, it falls back to the default 3×3 table for backward compatibility.
- **Pick local images in Rich Mode editor** — The image toolbar popover now includes a "📁 Pick Local Image" button that opens the native file picker dialog (via `vscode.window.showOpenDialog`). Selected images are copied to the configured `imageAssetsPath` directory and inserted into the editor with correct relative paths. Supports multi-select. The original URL input method is preserved below a divider.
- **Re-edit hyperlinks in Rich Mode** — Double-clicking an existing hyperlink in Rich Mode now opens the link editing popover with pre-filled URL, title, and display text. Users can modify the link's display text (the visible text content), URL, and title in one operation. The link popover now includes a "Display text" input field. The `link` ProseMirror command supports `attrs.text` to replace the link's visible content while preserving or updating the mark.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fix excessive spacing between task list items in Rich Mode (loose list)** — When task list items were separated by blank lines in Markdown (`- [ ] abc\n\n- [ ] 123`), the Rich Mode editor displayed excessive vertical spacing between checkboxes. Root cause: the `list_item` NodeView used `<span>` as `contentDOM`, but ProseMirror renders `<p>` (block element) inside it. HTML spec forbids block elements inside inline elements, causing browsers to "pop out" the `<p>` and break the layout. Fix: changed `contentDOM` from `<span>` to `<div>` in both the NodeView (`pm.entry.js`) and `toDOM` (`pm-schema.js`); added `contentElement` to `parseDOM` to correctly parse clipboard content from `.task-list-content` container.
- **Render task list checkboxes in Rich Mode editor** — Task list items (`- [ ] task` / `- [x] done`) now display interactive checkboxes in Rich Mode editing. Previously, the ProseMirror `list_item` node's `toDOM` only added a `task-list-item` CSS class without rendering an actual `<input type="checkbox">` element, causing task lists to appear as plain bullet points (●) instead of checkboxes (☐/☑). Fix: updated `pm-schema.js` `list_item.toDOM` to render a checkbox input + content wrapper when `checked !== null`; added a `list_item` NodeView in `pm.entry.js` that creates an interactive checkbox element (click to toggle checked state via `setNodeMarkup` transaction); added Rich Mode task list CSS styles in `markdown.css` for `#richModeContainer` (appearance, hover effects, checked state, dark theme support).
- **Fix task list `- [ ]` becoming escaped characters in Rich Mode** — When entering Rich Mode, task list items (`- [ ] task`) were parsed as regular list items with `[ ]` as literal text content. Upon exiting Rich Mode, the `prosemirror-markdown` serializer's `esc()` method escaped the brackets to `\[ \]`, corrupting the task list syntax. Root cause: markdown-it's commonmark mode does not support GFM task lists, so `[ ]`/`[x]` were never recognized as checkboxes. Fix: added a `taskListPlugin` core rule to markdown-it that detects `list_item_open` tokens whose inline content starts with `[ ]`/`[x]`/`[X]`, sets `meta.checked` on the token, and strips the checkbox prefix from the inline content. Updated the `MarkdownParser` config for `list_item` to read `checked` from `tok.meta`. Now the serializer correctly outputs `[ ] ` or `[x] ` prefix via the existing `list_item` serializer logic.
- **Prevent hyperlink navigation in Rich Mode editing** — Clicking a hyperlink in Rich Mode editor no longer triggers browser navigation. The `EditorView` now configures `handleDOMEvents.click` to detect `<a>` tags (via `tagName` check and `closest('a')` traversal) and call `event.preventDefault()`, while still allowing ProseMirror to handle cursor positioning normally. This ensures links are only editable (via double-click) and never accidentally navigated in edit mode.
- **Fix table context menu and hover overlay invisible in Rich Mode** — The `currentMode` variable was never set to `'rich'` when entering Rich Mode (both via toolbar button click and Ctrl+Shift+E shortcut). This caused all `currentMode !== 'rich'` guards to early-return, making the table right-click context menu, table hover "+" overlay buttons, task checkbox toggling, and documentContent input events completely non-functional. Root cause: the `switchMode('rich')` call was a no-op (it returned immediately for `'rich'` mode), and the `btnToggleRich` click handler never assigned `currentMode`. Fix: set `currentMode = 'rich'` in both the toolbar button click handler and the Ctrl+Shift+E shortcut handler when entering Rich Mode.
- **Fix pasted images not rendering in Rich Mode editor** — When pasting an image in Rich Mode, the image was saved to disk and a ProseMirror `image` node was inserted with a relative path (e.g. `assets/images/image-xxx.png`). However, the `Renderer._imageUriCache` did not contain a mapping for the newly saved image, so `image.toDOM()` fell back to the raw relative path which is inaccessible inside the webview sandbox — resulting in a broken image. Refreshing also failed because the cache was only built once during initial file load. Fix: `webviewHelper.ts` now returns the `webviewUri` alongside `relativePath` in the `imageSaved` response; `pm.entry.js` `handleImageSaved` updates the Renderer URI cache (both raw and decoded paths) before inserting the image node, ensuring `toDOM()` can resolve the correct webview URI immediately.

### 🔧 Improvements
- **Move Undo/Redo buttons to the first position in Rich Mode toolbar** — The Undo (Ctrl+Z) and Redo (Ctrl+Y) buttons are now placed at the very beginning of the editor toolbar (before Bold/Italic/etc.), making them more accessible and following common editor conventions where history controls appear first.
- **Use VS Code default editor background/foreground in Rich Mode** — `#richModeContainer .ProseMirror` now uses `var(--vscode-editor-background)` directly instead of the custom `--bg-white` variable, so the editor background always matches the active VS Code theme without extra overrides.

### ✨ Restored Features
- **Restore context menus for Markdown files** — Right-click context menus (`explorer/context`, `editor/context`, `editor/title`, `editor/title/context`) are back with a new `mdReview.openWithReview` command that opens Markdown files directly in the Custom Editor via `vscode.openWith`. The `Ctrl+Enter` keyboard shortcut in the file explorer is also restored.

### 🗑️ Removed
- **Removed `MD Human Review: Open Review Panel` command** — The standalone WebviewPanel mode (`mdReview.openPanel`) has been completely removed. Users should now use the context menu "Open with Review" or "Open With..." → "MD Human Review" (Custom Editor) to open Markdown files for review. The `ReviewPanel` class (`src/reviewPanel.ts`) has been deleted along with all associated activation events.

### ✨ New Features
- **Custom Editor Provider ("Open With..." integration)** — The extension now registers as a `CustomTextEditorProvider` for `.md`, `.mdc`, and `.markdown` files with `priority: "option"`. Users can right-click any Markdown file in VS Code Explorer → "Open With..." → "MD Human Review" to open it with native dirty-state indicators (●), Ctrl+S save, and close-confirmation dialogs. The existing `mdReview.openPanel` command continues to work as before.
- **Shared webview architecture** — Extracted webview HTML generation and message handling into `src/webviewHelper.ts`, enabling both the WebviewPanel mode and the new Custom Editor mode to share the same rendering and interaction logic without duplication.

### 🔧 Breaking Changes
- **Removed internal file list** — The file selector dropdown and refresh button have been removed from the toolbar. Users should now use VS Code's native file Explorer to navigate between Markdown files (right-click → "Open With..." or set MD Human Review as default editor).

### 🔧 Restored Features
- **Restored toolbar refresh button with three strategies** — The refresh button (`#btnRefresh`) has been restored to the toolbar with a popup menu offering three strategies: (1) Visual Refresh — re-renders current markdown without reading disk or modifying Store; (2) Disk Reload — re-reads file content, compares with current data, and creates a new review version snapshot if content changed; (3) Editor Reload — reverts the Custom Editor via `workbench.action.revertFile` (falls back to visual refresh in WebviewPanel mode). Both Disk Reload and Editor Reload check `TextDocument.isDirty` and show a modal confirmation dialog before discarding unsaved changes. File selector remains removed.

### ✅ Tests
- Added `test/suite/custom-editor-provider.test.ts` — 25 regression assertions covering Custom Editor registration (Tier 1: package.json config, file existence), shared helper usage (Tier 2: imports, function calls), and file list removal verification (Tier 3: no dead code remains). All 909 tests pass.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fix "cannot open file" TypeError after file-list removal** — `loadDocument()` still called the orphan `updateFileSelectHighlight()` helper, which invoked `document.getElementById('fileSelect').options` against a DOM element that was removed together with the internal file list. The resulting `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'options')` aborted `loadDocument` before `parseMarkdown` / rendering / annotation init, so users saw a blank webview when opening any `.md` file. Removed both the dead `updateFileSelectHighlight` function definition and its call site in `webview/js/app.js`. Added three regression assertions (`BT-custom-editor.26~28`) — asserting the function / call / bundle reference are all gone — so this dead code cannot silently resurrect.

### ✅ Tests (Hotfix)
- Extended `test/suite/custom-editor-provider.test.ts` with `BT-custom-editor.26~28` (Tier 1 / Tier 2 / Tier 3). All 912 tests pass.

### ✨ New Features
- **Alert block type selector** — Clicking the Alert block toolbar button (`#btnAlertBlock`) now opens a popover with 5 alert type options (📝 Note / 💡 Tip / ❗ Important / ⚠️ Warning / 🛑 Caution). Selecting a type wraps the current block in a `gh_alert` node with the chosen `alertType`; if the cursor is already inside an existing alert block, the type is switched in place (via `setNodeMarkup`) instead of nesting. The `alertBlock` PM command signature is extended to `(state, dispatch, view, attrs)`, accepting `attrs.alertType` and defaulting to `'NOTE'` for backwards compatibility.
- **Code block language selector** — Clicking the Code block toolbar button (`#btnCodeBlock`) now opens a popover with 12 common languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Bash, Shell, JSON, YAML, HTML, CSS, Markdown, SQL, Plain Text) plus a custom-language input row. Selecting a language inserts a `code_block` with the chosen info string; typing a custom language (e.g. "go", "rust") and pressing Enter or Apply does the same. If the cursor is already inside an existing code block, the language is switched in place. The `codeBlock` PM command signature is extended to `(state, dispatch, view, attrs)`, normalizes `attrs.language` via `.trim().toLowerCase()`, and defaults to `''` for backwards compatibility.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes (Rich Mode editor)
- **Fix custom color button** — Clicking the "Custom" button in the Text Color popover now opens the native OS color picker dialog (via `customInput.click()`) instead of silently reading a stale value. A `change` listener on the hidden `<input type="color">` dispatches the `textColor` command after the user confirms a color, closing all popovers afterward.
- **Fix task list round-trip** — The `taskList` toolbar command now produces valid GFM task-list markdown (`- [ ] item`). Previously the wrapped `list_item` nodes kept `checked === null`, which the Markdown serializer rendered as plain bullet items. The command now iterates the newly wrapped `bullet_list` via `setNodeMarkup` and assigns `{ checked: false }` to each list_item, guaranteeing `- [ ] ` output.
- **Fix link popover semantics** — Opening the link popover on an existing hyperlink now pre-fills the URL and title inputs (via new `getLinkAttrsAtSelection()` API) and selects the full link range so confirming replaces the link atomically. The `link` command now uses `removeMark` + `addMark` instead of `toggleMark` (replacement semantics), and an empty href is treated as "remove link" rather than being short-circuited.
- **Add "Delete entire table" context-menu entry** — The table context menu (right-click on a table cell) now has a destructive "🗑️ Delete entire table" item that dispatches a new `tableDelete` command (wrapping `deleteTable` from `prosemirror-tables`). Full i18n support (zh / en) added.
- **Add hover "+" overlay for adding rows / columns** — Hovering over a table in Rich Mode now shows two half-transparent "+" buttons: one below the last row (adds a new row) and one to the right of the last column (adds a new column). The overlay is scroll-synced via rAF and cleaned up on `rich-mode-exit`.
- **Fix Rich Mode background in light theme** — `#richModeContainer .ProseMirror` now uses `var(--bg-white, var(--vscode-editor-background, #ffffff))` so it follows the active VS Code theme. Additional scoped rules for `pre` / `code` / `.frontmatter` / `.math-inline` / `.math-display` ensure readable contrast on light backgrounds.
- **Raise table context menu viewport clamp to 360 px** — The viewport clamp for the table context menu's top position was raised from 320 to 360 px margin so the newly added "Delete entire table" row is never clipped by the bottom of the window.

### ✅ Tests
- Added `test/suite/rich-mode-editor-bugfix.test.ts` — 23 regression assertions across Tier 1 (existence: 9), Tier 2 (bundle behaviour: 6), and Tier 3 (per-bug named `BT-RichModeBugfix.*`: 8). All 838 tests pass.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-30

### ✨ New Features
- **Extend Rich Mode editor toolbar** — Added 13 new toolbar buttons: Inline Code, Text Color (with 8 preset colors + custom picker), Highlight, Task List, Hyperlink (with URL input popover), Image (with URL/alt input popover), Alert Block, Code Block, Table (inserts 3×3), Mermaid diagram, PlantUML diagram, Graphviz diagram, and Emoji (with 80-emoji picker panel). Toolbar buttons are organized into functional groups with separators. All buttons support i18n tooltips and active state detection.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fix toolbar popover breaking page rendering** — Popover panels (color picker, link input, image input, emoji grid) were incorrectly nested inside `<button>` elements, which violates HTML spec (buttons cannot contain interactive content like `<div>`, `<input>`, `<button>`). This caused browsers to break the DOM structure during parsing, corrupting the entire page layout. Fixed by wrapping each popover button in a `<div class="toolbar-btn-wrapper">` container that holds both the button and its popover as siblings.
- **Fix image upload in comment modal** — The "Add Image" click zone in the comment modal now uses `vscode.window.showOpenDialog` via Extension Host instead of relying on `<input type="file">` which may not work in certain VS Code webview environments (Cursor, CodeBuddy, etc.). Drag-and-drop and Ctrl+V paste remain as alternative upload methods. Falls back to native file input if `showOpenDialog` fails.
- **Fix image rendering in Rich Mode (edit mode)** — Images with relative paths (e.g. `./images/foo.png`) now render correctly in Rich Mode by resolving paths through the Renderer's image URI cache (`webview.asWebviewUri`). Previously, ProseMirror's `image` node `toDOM` used raw relative paths which are inaccessible in the webview sandbox.
- **Fix Rich Mode save failure** — Saving in Rich Mode (including after deleting images) now works correctly. The `handleSaveMd` function was calling `Exporter.saveViaHost()` which is not exported from the Exporter module, causing `TypeError: Exporter.saveViaHost is not a function`. Fixed by using `callHost('saveFile', { filePath, content })` to properly save the source file via Extension Host.
- **Fix annotation changes not auto-saved to disk** — Annotation operations (add, delete, update) now correctly trigger `Exporter.triggerAutoSave()` via `refreshView()`, ensuring the `.review` record files on disk are updated after every annotation change. Previously, annotation changes were only saved to webview state but never persisted to disk until a file reload or manual trigger.
- **Fix document not refreshing after exiting Rich Mode** — Exiting Rich Mode (ProseMirror editor) now automatically re-renders the document preview with the latest edited content. Previously, the `rich-mode-exit` event handler called `switchMode('rich')` which immediately returned without refreshing, leaving stale content in the preview pane. Fixed by calling `refreshCurrentView()` directly to re-parse and render the updated `rawMarkdown`.
- **Fix disk record not updated after deleting all annotations in v1** — The `doAutoSave` empty-annotation branch now unconditionally persists to disk via `saveViaHost`, regardless of `reviewVersion`. Previously, when `reviewVersion === 1`, the empty branch skipped disk write and only updated UI status. This caused a bug where deleting all annotations one by one in v1 left the old record (with annotations) on disk, which would be incorrectly restored on next file open.
- **Hide TOC and annotations panels in Rich Mode** — The table-of-contents panel and annotations panel are now automatically hidden when entering Rich Mode editing, providing a distraction-free editing experience. Panels are restored when exiting Rich Mode.
- **Add Rich Mode editor toolbar** — A formatting toolbar now appears at the top of the editing area when entering Rich Mode. Includes buttons for Bold, Italic, Strikethrough, H1/H2/H3, Unordered/Ordered List, Blockquote, Horizontal Rule, Undo, and Redo. Buttons reflect the current cursor context (active marks and block type are highlighted). The toolbar uses VS Code theme colors and existing i18n translations.

### 💥 Breaking Changes
- **Remove Source Mode editor** — The CodeMirror 6 Source Mode (`</>` toolbar button) has been completely removed. Users who need raw Markdown editing can open the `.md` file directly in VS Code / Cursor's native editor (same window, adjacent tab)
- **Remove `#btnToggleSource` button** — The Source Mode toggle button no longer exists in the toolbar
- **Remove `EditMode.enterSource()` / `exitSource()` / `isSourceActive()` API** — The state machine in `edit-mode.js` is now two-state (`INACTIVE` / `RICH`) instead of three-state

### ✨ Changes
- **Rich Mode icon updated** — The Rich Mode toolbar button icon changed from a paragraph mark (`¶`) to a pencil (`✎`), reflecting its new status as the sole editor
- **Rich Mode pencil icon refined** — Replaced the minimal two-stroke pencil SVG with a more detailed and recognizable pencil icon (closed path with tip, body, and edit-line indicator)
- **Rich Mode is now the only editor** — Click the pencil button to enter structured rich-text editing. All Rich Mode features (PM schema, diagram NodeView, annotation decorations, smart paste) remain unchanged

### 🗑️ Removed
- `webview/src/entries/cm6.entry.js` — CodeMirror 6 entry point (deleted)
- `webview/dist/cm6.bundle.js` — ~1 MB CodeMirror 6 bundle output (no longer built)
- 7 production dependencies removed: `@codemirror/commands`, `@codemirror/lang-markdown`, `@codemirror/language`, `@codemirror/search`, `@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view`, `@lezer/markdown`
- Source Mode CSS rules (`body.source-mode-active`, `#sourceModeContainer`, `#btnToggleSource.active`) removed from `markdown.css`
- Source Mode i18n keys (`edit_mode.source_toggle_tooltip`, `edit_mode.source`, `edit_mode.source_hint`, `edit_mode.source_exit_hint`) removed from both zh and en locales
- `test/suite/dual-mode-editor-phase-a.test.ts` — 42 Source Mode test assertions (deleted)
- `cm6.bundle` esbuild entry removed from `webview/build.config.mjs`
- `cm6BundleUri` variable and placeholder replacement removed from `src/reviewPanel.ts`

### 📝 Migration
- Users who previously used Source Mode for raw Markdown editing can open the `.md` file in VS Code / Cursor's built-in editor — the file is already open in a tab adjacent to the review panel
- No data migration required — both engines always read/wrote the same `Store.rawMarkdown`

### 🐛 Fixes
- Fix Rich Mode crash on documents containing block-level HTML (e.g. `<div>`, `<details>`, `<table>` as raw HTML): the `html_block` and `html_inline` ignore mappings in `MarkdownParser` were missing `noCloseToken: true`, causing the parser to register handlers for `html_block_open`/`html_block_close` instead of `html_block` — but markdown-it emits `html_block` as a standalone token without `_open`/`_close` variants

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-30

### ✨ Dual-Mode Editor (Phase A + B + C)
- **New: Source Mode** — CodeMirror 6 engine for direct Markdown source editing. Toggle via the `</>` toolbar button. Features: syntax highlighting, line numbers, search (Ctrl+F), VS Code theme integration, keyboard shortcut passthrough (Ctrl+E/Alt+Z/F5 forwarded to host)
- **New: Rich Mode** — ProseMirror engine for structured rich-text editing. Toggle via the `¶` toolbar button. Features: full PM schema (20 nodes + 11 marks covering all Markdown features), Markdown↔PM bidirectional bridge (5 custom markdown-it plugins, completely bypasses turndown), diagram NodeView (preview + double-click to edit), annotation decorations (visible and drift-aware in Rich Mode), smart paste (HTML→Markdown→PM doc normalization)
- **Three-state machine** — `edit-mode.js` manages `inactive` / `source` / `rich` states with mutual exclusion. Only one editor mode can be active at a time
- **Markdown as single source of truth** — Both modes read from and write back to `Store.getData().rawMarkdown`. Source Mode uses CM6 `onChange` callback; Rich Mode uses PM serializer. No intermediate HTML→Markdown conversion needed

### 🗑️ Removed (BREAKING)
- **Remove legacy contenteditable WYSIWYG editing** — The old editing path that set `contenteditable="true"` on `#documentContent` and used turndown for HTML→Markdown conversion has been completely removed. This eliminates ~1,200 lines of dead code including: `createTurndownService()`, `blockHtmlToMarkdown()`, `extractTextFromNode()`, block-level snapshot/diff system, `convertDiagramsToEditable()`, `protectFrontmatterInEditMode()`, `showEditModeTips()`, and the WYSIWYG toolbar
- **Remove `#btnModeToggle` button** — The old pencil/eye toggle button is replaced by dedicated Source (`</>`) and Rich (`¶`) buttons
- **Remove `#wysiwygToolbar`** — The old formatting toolbar (Bold/Italic/Heading/List/Quote/Undo/Redo) is removed. Rich Mode provides its own PM-native editing commands
- **Remove `turndown.js` vendored library** — No code path references turndown anymore. PM serializer handles Rich→Markdown; Source Mode works with raw text directly
- **Remove turndown-safety spec** — The `edit-mode-turndown-safety` capability spec (escape identity, kbd keep, table br/align, diag log) is archived as the entire turndown pipeline no longer exists

### 🐛 Fixes
- Fix Rich Mode (ProseMirror) having no UI entry button after Phase C cleanup: the `#btnModeToggle` button was incorrectly removed as legacy code, but Phase B had repurposed it as the Rich Mode toggle. Added a dedicated `#btnToggleRich` button with proper click handler calling `EditMode.enterRich()`/`EditMode.exitRich()`, matching the existing `#btnToggleSource` pattern. Added `rich_toggle_tooltip` i18n key (zh/en). Updated `source-mode-exit` and `rich-mode-exit` event handlers to clear button active states
- Fix Rich Mode crash on documents containing tables: `MarkdownParser` token mapping was missing `table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tr`, `th`, `td` entries, causing `Token type 'table_open' not supported` error. Added all 6 table token mappings (`table`→`table`, `tr`→`table_row`, `th`→`table_header`, `td`→`table_cell`, `thead`/`tbody`→`ignore`) with `align` attribute extraction from `text-align` style
- Fix Rich Mode crash on documents containing inline HTML tags: `MarkdownParser` had no handler for `html_inline` / `html_block` tokens (emitted by markdown-it when `html: true`), causing `Token type 'html_inline' not supported` error on any document containing `<br>`, `<kbd>`, `<mark>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`, `<ins>`, `<u>`, or other HTML tags. Added a new `htmlTagConverterPlugin` core rule that rewrites `html_inline` tokens into PM-compatible tokens: `<br>`→`hardbreak`, `<kbd>`/`<mark>`/`<sub>`/`<sup>`/`<ins>`/`<u>` (and their closing counterparts) → corresponding PM mark open/close tokens. Unknown HTML tags degrade to plain text tokens (safe fallback). Added parser mappings for `kbd`/`mark`/`subscript`/`superscript`/`underline` marks plus `html_inline`/`html_block` ignore safety net
- Fix Zen Mode not restoring VS Code Auxiliary Bar and Bottom Panel on exit: the `zenModeChanged` handler in `reviewPanel.ts` only called `toggleSidebarVisibility` when leaving Zen Mode, completely missing the right-side Auxiliary Bar and Bottom Panel that were closed on entry. Added `_zenClosedBars` instance field to track which IDE areas were closed, and symmetrically call `toggleAuxiliaryBar` + `togglePanel` alongside `toggleSidebarVisibility` on exit

### 🏗️ Build
- `app.bundle.js` reduced from 370KB to 329KB (~11% smaller) after dead code removal
- `cm6.bundle.js` = 1.0MB (CodeMirror 6 + Markdown language support)
- `pm.bundle.js` = 1.1MB (ProseMirror + schema + serializer + markdown-it plugins)
- 12 new npm dependencies for ProseMirror (`prosemirror-*`), 7 for CodeMirror (`@codemirror/*` + `@lezer/markdown`)

### 📝 Notes
- Version bump: `1.3.12` → `1.4.0` (minor release — significant new capability)
- 710 tests passing, 0 failing (73 legacy turndown/WYSIWYG tests removed, net reduction from 783)
- Published to both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX Registry

## [1.3.12] - 2026-04-29

### 🏗️ Build (add-webview-bundler-and-esm-modules)
- Introduce `esbuild` as the webview bundler (devDependency `esbuild@^0.24.0`). The new build script `webview/build.config.mjs` produces IIFE bundles targeting ES2020, chained into `npm run compile`. Two additional commands `build:webview` and `build:webview:watch` are available for standalone/hot-reload development
- Migrate `webview/js/*.js` (7 modules: i18n, store, renderer, annotations, export, settings, app) to ESM: each module now ends with `export { ModuleName };`; `app.js` is refactored from an immediately-invoked IIFE to `export function initApp()`, started explicitly by a unified entry `webview/src/entries/main.entry.js`. Function bodies unchanged — only the top-level wrappers and export statements differ
- Reserve bundler entry slots `cm6.entry.js` and `pm.entry.js` (placeholder exports only in this change) for the upcoming dual-mode editor (CodeMirror 6 + ProseMirror) planned in the next change
- Simplify `webview/index.html` script loading: replaces 7 `<script src="${xxxUri}">` tags with a single `<script src="${appBundleUri}"></script>`. `src/reviewPanel.ts` updated accordingly (1 URI instead of 7). Existing CSP stays intact (`script-src 'nonce-${nonce}' ${cspSource}` covers the same-origin bundle)
- Zero user-visible change: all rendering, annotation, export, search, i18n, theme, and diagram (Mermaid/PlantUML/Graphviz/KaTeX) behaviors remain byte-identical to the pre-change baseline
- Test coverage: 726 existing regression tests remain green; +13 new assertions under new suite `webview-build-system.test.ts` (Tier 1: 7 existence checks + Tier 2: 1 structural check + Tier 3: 5 BT-BuildSystem.* behavioral checks). Total: 739 passing, 0 failing

### 🐛 Fixes (fix-edit-mode-turndown-safety)
- Fix edit-mode save path no longer adds backslash escapes to plain prose characters `*`, `_`, and `\`: the default `TurndownService.escape` was backslash-doubling these three characters inside normal prose, breaking Windows paths (`C:\Users\foo` → `C:\\Users\\foo`), snake_case identifiers, and literal asterisks. Override `ts.escape` with an identity function so prose round-trips unchanged. Verified via one-shot jsdom probe: `#`, `|`, `$`, `$$` were NOT actually escaped by default (contrary to common assumption), so the fix targets exactly the three confirmed offenders
- Fix `<kbd>` HTML tag being silently dropped to plain text during edit-mode save: `<p>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd></p>` became `Press Ctrl`, losing the semantic tag. Register `<kbd>` in the turndown keep-list so it survives as raw inline HTML (matching how `<u>`/`<sub>`/`<sup>`/`<mark>`/`<ins>` already work via addRule)
- Fix table cell `<br>` producing three spaces instead of GFM-standard two-space line break: pre-normalize `<br>`, `<br/>`, `<br />` in cell innerHTML to two spaces before feeding to turndown
- Fix table column alignment (`<th align="left|center|right">`) being lost during save: always produced `---` separator regardless of alignment. Now reads `align` attribute and emits `:---` / `:---:` / `---:` / `---` accordingly. Wrapped in `window.__TURNDOWN_TABLE_V2__` feature flag (default enabled) for emergency rollback

### ✨ Features
- Add `[DIAG:turndown] unknown-tags` diagnostic log gated by `window.__DEBUG_TURNDOWN__ === true`: when developers need to investigate user-reported "format lost on save" bugs, enabling this flag in DevTools prints the list of HTML tags encountered during save that did not match any turndown rule or the known-tags whitelist, making gaps in rule coverage observable. Default off, zero noise in production

### 📝 Scope Notes
- Mathematical formulas (`$x=1$`, `$$E=mc^2$$`) were NOT previously broken by escape — the turndown library does not escape `$` by default (verified empirically). No change needed here
- Empty table cells `<td></td>` currently output `|  |` with two spaces, which is GFM-compliant. Unchanged to avoid regression risk
- Block-level diff alignment (`normalizeHtmlForCompare` robustness against `<br>` vs `<br/>` and contenteditable DOM noise) is a known edge that remains scheduled for a separate change (the upcoming dual-mode editor)
- Known limitation: users manually typing literal `*text*` in Rich Mode and expecting it to render as plain text will now see it interpreted as emphasis; Rich Mode UI does not expose such an entry point, so normal paths are unaffected

## [1.3.11] - 2026-04-23

### 🔧 Improvements
- Reduce toolbar height from 44px to 36px for an even more compact header layout
- Reduce file selector max-width from 260px to 195px (75% of original) for a more compact toolbar layout
- Replace Zen Mode button icon from nested rectangles to concentric circles SVG for a cleaner, more intuitive visual metaphor
- Reduce help button circle size from 28px to 22px for better proportion with other toolbar elements
- Reduce toolbar height from 56px to 44px for a more compact header layout
- Remove text labels from toolbar buttons (TOC, Zen Mode, Theme, Preview/Edit mode, Annotations) to show icons only, reducing toolbar clutter; also remove dynamically updated text on theme/zen mode toggle so buttons remain icon-only after state changes
- Rename "一键AI修复" button label to "AI Fix" for shorter display; restore annotation count badge on annotations button (number-only, hidden when zero)
- Compact settings panel layout: reduce header padding (20px→14px top, 16px→10px bottom), title font (22px→20px), body padding/gap, card header/body padding and gap for a denser settings UI
- Reduce document content area vertical spacing: padding top/bottom from 32px to 20px, margin from 16px to 8px for a tighter layout

### ✨ Features
- Add visual regression testing (screenshot comparison) using Playwright `toHaveScreenshot()` API: 10 test cases covering basic rendering, tables, code blocks, alert blocks, Mermaid charts, math formulas, dark/light themes, and toolbar; fixed viewport (1280×720) with 1% pixel diff tolerance; `npm run test:ui:update-snapshots` script for baseline regeneration

### 🐛 Fixes
- Fix Mermaid gitGraph rendering failure ("svg element not in render tree"): pass `container` as the third argument to `mermaid.render()` so the temporary SVG is inserted into a visible DOM element, allowing `getBBox()` to compute text dimensions correctly
- Fix help modal showing double scrollbars by setting `overflow-y: hidden` on `.modal-help` so only the inner `.help-content` scrolls
- Fix `toggleZenMode()` still appending text labels (`+ t('toolbar.exit_zen')` / `+ t('toolbar.zen')`) to button innerHTML after toggle, inconsistent with `updateZenButtonLabel()` which was already fixed to icon-only
- Fix YAML front matter being corrupted after editing in WYSIWYG mode: `%%FRONTMATTER%%` internal marker prefix was written to file on save, and turndown conversion destroyed `---` delimiters when frontmatter card content was modified
- Fix frontmatter card rows disappearing when edited in WYSIWYG mode: set `contentEditable="false"` on the card container and `contentEditable="true"` only on `.fm-value` spans, preventing browser's default editing behavior from destroying the card's DOM structure
- Fix code blocks incorrectly rendering underscored variable names (e.g. `{cos_name}`, `{file_count}`) with wrong color in dark themes: highlight.js wraps `_xxx_` in `<span class="hljs-emphasis">` (not `<em>`), causing text to become nearly invisible; use regex to strip full `hljs-emphasis`/`hljs-strong` tag pairs while preserving inner text
- Fix `hljs-quote` span swallowing subsequent content in markdown code blocks: when a `>` blockquote line contains an unclosed `_` (e.g. `node_modules`), highlight.js emphasis spans across paragraph boundaries, causing the outer `hljs-quote` to also span across blank lines and incorrectly color subsequent headings/text; detect and strip `hljs-quote` spans whose content crosses blank lines (`\n\n`)
- Fix markdown structures (headings / blockquotes / bullet lists) losing syntax highlighting after being swallowed by unclosed-underscore emphasis in code blocks: for `markdown`/`md` language code blocks, after stripping the incorrect `hljs-emphasis`/`hljs-quote` spans, re-tag bare markdown structures line-by-line with the proper `hljs-section` / `hljs-quote` / `hljs-bullet` classes so that e.g. `rules_PT\n\n# 标题` correctly highlights `# 标题` as a section instead of plain text
- Fix mis-colored `hljs-code` regions and missing `hljs-quote` on the last blockquote line when runaway emphasis corrupts inline-code backtick pairing in markdown code blocks: when a quoted line contains `node_modules` + `npm install` backtick spans, the unclosed `_` scrambles highlight.js state so that a chunk of plain text between two backticks gets wrapped as `hljs-code`, and the outer `hljs-quote` on that line is lost; detect runaway emphasis (inner `\n\n`) as a root-cause signal and, when present, strip all `hljs-code` spans in the block and wrap any `&gt; ` line (even those containing residual hljs spans) with `hljs-quote`

### 🔧 Improvements
- Enhance dark theme table readability: add explicit `color` on `td` cells, add border and enhanced contrast for inline code inside tables, and add explicit `color` for `strong` text inside tables
- Change default code highlight theme from `default-dark-modern` to `default-light-modern` for better readability in light theme environments
- Add missing `.hljs-code` color definitions for `default-dark-modern`, `default-light-modern`, `atom-one-dark`, `atom-one-light`, `vs2015`, and `one-dark-pro` themes to ensure Markdown inline code (backtick content) is visually distinct in code blocks
